# Getting started

1. Create a new virtual environment

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv env
    ```

2. Switch to the new interpreter in VS Code (the one with `venv` in the name)

3. On the console, activate the environment

    ```sh
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
