Cumulocity
==========
Scope:    GLOBAL

Cumulocity Robot Framework Library

Keywords used to interact and make assertions with Cumulocity IoT

Example:

The "Device Should Exist" keyword will set the context of the device so that
subsequent
keywords will not need to explicity set the device that the keyword is related
to.

Assert that software packages are installed (in the c8y_SoftwareList fragment)

Args:
    mo (str, optional): Device Managed object. Defaults to None.
        If set to None, then the current device managed object context
        will be used.

Returns:
    str: Managed object json

Device Should Have Measurements
-------------------------------
Arguments:  [minimum: int = 1, maximum: int | None = None, **kwargs]

Assert measurement count

Args:
    minimum (int, optional): Minimum number of events to expect. Defaults to
1.
    maximum (int, optional): Maximum number of events to expect. Defaults to
None.

Returns:
    List[str]: List of measurements as json

Event Should Have An Attachment

    encoding (str, optional): Attachment encoding to use when comparing
content.
        Defaults to None.

Returns:
    bytes: Attachment

Event Should Not Have An Attachment
-----------------------------------
Arguments:  [event_id: str, **kwargs]

Assert that an event does not have an attachment

Args:
    event_id (str): Event id

Install Software
----------------
Arguments:  [*software_list: str, **kwargs]

Install software via an operation

It does not wait for the operation to be completed. Use with the operation
keywords to check if the operation was successful or not.

Returns:
    AssertOperation: Operation

Operation Should Be DONE
------------------------
Arguments:  [operation: AssertOperation, **kwargs]

Assert that the operation is set to either SUCCESSFUL or FAILED
(e.g. a final state)

--------------------------
Arguments:  [operation: AssertOperation, failure_reason: str = .+, **kwargs]

Assert that the operation is set to FAILED

Args:

Returns:
    str: Operation as json

Operation Should Not Be PENDING
-------------------------------
Arguments:  [operation: AssertOperation, **kwargs]

Assert that the operation is not set to PENDING

Args:
    operation (AssertOperation): Operation

Returns:
    str: Operation as json

Set API Timeout
---------------
Arguments:  [timeout: float = 30]

Set global assertion timeout

This controls the default timeout when an assertion should
be given up on.

should be a child device of the current device context.

Returns:
    str: Managed object json
